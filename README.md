"Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze bank customer churn. The dashboard should provide insights into key churn factors, customer demographics, and predictive indicators. The analysis should include:

Data Overview: Display key statistics like total customers, churn rate, and customer distribution.
Customer Segmentation: Visualize churn trends across demographics (age, gender, geography, etc.).
Account & Transaction Insights: Show how factors like account balance, tenure, transaction activity, and credit score affect churn.
Churn Prediction Analysis: Use DAX measures to calculate churn probability based on customer behavior.
Trend Analysis: Identify patterns over time using line charts and time-based filters.
Interactive Filters: Enable drill-down capabilities by region, age group, or account type.
Key Findings & Recommendations: Summarize actionable insights to reduce churn.
The dashboard should be visually engaging, using a consistent color theme and clear labeling. It should be designed for bank executives to make data-driven decisions."
